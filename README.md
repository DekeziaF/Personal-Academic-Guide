# Personal-Academic-Guide
The personal Academic Guide is a final project web application created with my college Keilon Robertson that provides students with the ability to manage school related activities, 
specifically, exams, courses, notes, and assignments.

The Personal Academic Guide is a basic desktop application that targets students attending the University of the Southern Caribbean. 
The aim of the application is to provide a single end user the ability to organize his/her degree content into a detailed and systemized format. 
The end users for this application at the point of its first release are projected to be students at the undergraduate level. 
The application seeks to provide a platform where these students can efficiently manage their courses, exams, assignments and class notes.
The Personal Academic Guide can therefore be categorized into four main features; exam timetable, course, assignments and notes. 
Each of which seeks to enhance the way students manage and organize their school related activities. 
These four features have four main functionalities which include the ability to add, delete, update and view. 
The exam feature varies from the course, assignment and note features, in that it allows students to view their exams in a timetabled format. 
Students can view individual exams that may be timetabled on a specific day, therefore aiding them in staying abreast. 
The course feature, apart from the four basic functions, allows students to separate their current courses from their past or completed courses. 
They are able to keep a record of their grades earned for their past courses along with its respective details.
